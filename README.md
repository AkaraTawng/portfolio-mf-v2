# Site works best in Chrome.

# Why? ü§î
- This is my first professional portfolio site. It took me weeks of daily devlopment to finish it. It is the biggest, most complex, and most challenging independent project I've worked on so far. It's also my first independant React.JS project. Every step of the way was a challenge and a learning curve - from React Router being updated and having to learn how to use the newest version to figuring out how to link to external websites. Therefore, this has been one of the most enriching projects that I've done.
